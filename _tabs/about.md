"meanwhile in a secret room" is the headspace of [Michael Franke](https://michael-franke.github.io/heimseite/).
I would self-identify as a computational cognitive scientist with a strong interest in higher-order cognition, first and foremost the way we use language in communication.

The title "meanwhile in a ..." is a phrase from the point-and-click adventure [Zack McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_McKracken_and_the_Alien_Mindbenders#:~:text=Zak%20McKracken%3A%20Between%20Time%20and,%22Artificial%20Hair%20Bros.%22.), which made a huge impression on a ten-year old me. (Both the phrase and the rest of the game; for whatever obscure reason strange things get stuck in naive minds.)
In the early 2000's I drafted a novel with that title.
My biggest contribution to humanity so far is that this was never published.

There is no plan behind this blog.
It's mostly therapeutic for me to get things out of my head.
Yet there is also a hope that at least some of this content is useful or at least entertaining for somebody out there.
